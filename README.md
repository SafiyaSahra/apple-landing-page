# Apple Website Landing Page

This is my final assignment of [Pirple](https://www.pirple.com/) Frontend Fundamentals course. 


## Challenge and Experience ðŸ’ª

They told to design the landing page of one of given website. Then I have selected Apple's website because that's a simple and modern website. But when I was coding the prototype of apple website, it's not that easy as I thought ðŸ˜“. But eventually I have done the design of the prototype of apple.com.

**I finished up this landing page using basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I used Visual Studio Code as an editor. I tried my best to design the site as original view. But this page isn't a mobile responsive.**

One of the difference in my page is the font-family. In the original page they'd used 'San Francisco Text Pro' font type but it didn't support in windows... So instead of that I used ' -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI" , sans-serif ' font, also can use ' "Helvetica Neue" , Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif '...


*Note:* Apple website landing page could be continuosly change due to new products. So it could be little inconvinience to compare both. I re-designed the page according to the page that existed on September 2020.
